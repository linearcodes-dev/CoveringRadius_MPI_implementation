# MPI Parallel implementation of computes the Covering Radius of Linear Codes
Here we give a Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel implementation (uploaded .cpp, file) of a known algorithm for computing the Covering Radius of Linear Codes $C$ over Finite Fields using a Parity-Check Matrix. The algorithm is based on generation of linear combinations of the columns of a parity-check matrix $H_{n-k*n}$ and therefore the corresponding syndromes of $C$.
