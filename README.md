# MPI Parallel implementation of computes the Covering Radius of Linear Codes
Here we give a Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel implementation (uploaded .cpp, file) of a known algorithm for computing the Covering Radius of Linear $[n,k]\_q$ Codes $C$ over Finite Fields using a Parity-Check Matrix. The algorithm is based on generation of linear combinations of the columns of a parity-check matrix $H_{n-k*n}$ and therefore the corresponding syndromes of $C$. The parallelization is based on partitioning the ordered set $V_n^L$ that corresponds to all nonproportional linear combinations of up to $L$ columns of $H$. For this purpose, we present ranking and unranking functions as well as generating an ordered subset for $V_n^L$.
