# MPI Parallel implementation of finding the Covering Radius of Linear Codes over Finite Fields Using a Parity-Check Matrix
Here we give a Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel implementation (uploaded .cpp, file) of a known algorithm for finding the Covering Radius of Linear Codes over Finite Fields Using a Parity-Check Matrix. Parallel
